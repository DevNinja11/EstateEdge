## My Contributions

As a Full Stack Java Developer on the EstateEdge, I was deeply involved in creating a smooth and engaging user experience. I worked on the frontend using Angular and TypeScript to build a responsive, user-friendly interface, and used TailwindCSS to ensure the design was both modern and consistent. I also integrated Swiper to add a dynamic image carousel for showcasing properties. On the backend, I developed the applicationâ€™s core functionalities with Spring Boot, set up secure user authentication and authorization with Spring Security, and handled data management with Spring Data JPA and MySQL. Additionally, I implemented features like image uploads and notifications to enhance the overall user experience. My role was pivotal in delivering a polished, feature-rich platform that meets the needs of our users.
